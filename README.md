## ❗ Prerequisites

You need to be using old reddit, to be able to do so follow these instructions:

*Go to your user settings (drop down in the top right, click user settings), and at the very bottom should be a toggle that says "Opt out of the redesign", click that and you should be using old reddit!.*

[Stylus browser extension](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases)

## 💻 Installation

**For this style to work properly, you need to uncheck "_allow subreddits to show me custom themes_" in your [preferences](https://old.reddit.com/prefs)!**
