## ❗ Prerequisites

You need to be using old reddit, to be able to do so follow these instructions:

*Go to your user settings (drop down in the top right, click user settings), and at the very bottom should be a toggle that says "Opt out of the redesign", click that and you should be using old reddit!.*
